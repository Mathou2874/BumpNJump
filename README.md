#### Code
To launch the code `run.py` use the following code files:
* `helpers.py`: Deal with the creation of the spectrum, building of the neural network and the plots
* `benchmarking.py`: Functions used for the benchmarking. It is composed of computation of the loss against the number of epochs and the recall, accuracy, precision and F1-score against the spectrum.

The `datasets` folder is also needed to store the full data set. For the experiment, the data set `bank-additional-full.csv` is used. In this folder, the datasheet `bank-additional-full.csv` is used for the experiment.
